* Ensure responses with a failure are cleaned up from the outstanding request table to avoid memory leaks


## 1.5.1 - 2021-05-08

* Unified DFS path handling when using any API that uses a transaction to open the file
  * This includes `smbclient.rename` and `smbclient.replace`
* Fixed up `smbclient.rename` to work with directories
* `smbclient.scandir` will continue to use the connection cache when getting stat information of a dir entry
* `smbclient.shutil.rmtree` will continue to use the connection cache when removing child entries


## 1.5.0 - 2021-03-25

* Added `smbprotocol.exceptions.SMBConnectionClosed` that is raised when trying to send or receive data on a connection that has been closed
* Added `smbprotocol.exceptions.WrongPassword` that is raised when some servers indicate the password is not correct or the account is locked out
* Do not attempt to reuse any cached connections that have been closed in `smbclient`
* Added a lock when writing to the socket, only 1 thread can write a message at a single point in time
* Revamped the SMB receiver code to simplify the logic and make it more durable
    * Removed the TCP recv thread for each connection, now each connection uses just 1 thread instead of 2
    * Be more defensive when reading data from a socket to ensure we get all the data we require
    * Handled server side FIN packets that close the connection unexpectedly, any requests waiting for a response will raise `SMBConnectionClosed`


## 1.4.0 - 2021-02-02

* Fixed up secure negotiation logic when connecting to older SMB dialects
* Will attempt to perform secure negotiation even on older dialects that may not implement it properly
* Added `ClientConfig` option `require_secure_negotiate` to globally turn off secure negotiation if the client wishes
* Fix explicit `ntlm` or `kerberos` authentication when the server response with the initial SPNEGO mech list token


## 1.3.0 - 2021-01-23

* Changed initial credit request from `256` to `64` when creating the SMB session
    * This is done to avoid overloading the SMB server
    * If `smbclient` requires more credits to perform an operation it will request it automatically
* Improve credit handling when reading and writing large amounts of data to reduce the number of requests being made
* Fixed up `write()` in `smbclient.open_file()` to be able to write bytes greater than the `max_write_size`
* Fixed issue when receiving an unknown NtStatus error code from the server
* Added `PipeBusy` exception for `STATUS_PIPE_NOT_AVAILABLE 0xC00000AD` error responses
* Fix credit granting calculation when receiving a compound response
    * Original logic granted `len(responses) - 1` credits than what the server actually given causing errors when the client ran out of credits without it knowing
* Added `auth_protocol` to `Session`, `ClientConfig`, and `register_session()` to control what authentication protocol is used
    * This can be `negotiate` (default), `kerberos`, or `ntlm` where `negotiate` selects `kerberos` or `ntlm` depending on what's available


## 1.2.0 - 2020-09-22

* Added experimental support for DFS shares when using `smbclient` function
* Added `smbclient.ClientConfig()` to set global default options on new connections

* Dropped support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.4
